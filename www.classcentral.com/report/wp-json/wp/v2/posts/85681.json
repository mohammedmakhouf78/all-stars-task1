Developed in 2014 by Ary Borenszweig, Juan Wajnerman, Brian Cardiff, and a team of over 300 contributors, Crystal has a seductive tagline: \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8FvrBLWUwxc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fast as C, slick as Ruby<\/a>\u201d.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Fast as C: <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/digitalcollection.zhaw.ch\/bitstream\/11475\/22807\/4\/2021_Ganz-Spielberger_Performance-evaluation-of-Crystal.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Crystal is about 10% slower than C<\/a>. This is quite impressive considering that C is a low-level language with no garbage collection while Crystal is a high-level language with garbage collection. In comparison, Ruby is about 8 times slower than Crystal. Crystal\u2019s blazingly fast performance can be attributed to its LLVM compiler infrastructure, the same compiler technology used by C and C++ itself, as well as other famously fast languages such as Fortran, Rust, and Julia. Crystal also prides itself on its C interoperability, making it easy to call native C libraries. And if you want to see how Crystal fares in real-world usage, just compare the <a href=\"https:\/\/kemalcr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kemal<\/a> framework (Crystal) to Sinatra (Ruby) and Ruby on Rails (Ruby) in the barchart below.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<figure id=\"attachment_85691\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85691\" style=\"width: 705px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85691\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Crystal-Chart-Speed.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"705\" height=\"436\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Crystal-Chart-Speed.png 705w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Crystal-Chart-Speed-300x186.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 705px) 100vw, 705px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-85691\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Chart created by Dmitry Rocha, from <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.codeminer42.com\/crystal-by-numbers-8a675b0572fc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Crystal by Numbers Benchmarking Kemal, Ruby on Rails, and Sinatra | The Miners<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Slick as Ruby:<\/b> Crystal\u2019s syntax is heavily inspired by Ruby\u2009\u2014\u2009if you\u2019re a Ruby veteran, you\u2019ll feel right at home. But if you have not touched Ruby in your life, you\u2019ll still find yourself picking up the language quite fast due to its simple, human-readable syntax. Additionally, Crystal has a built-in package manager called Shards (similar to Ruby\u2019s gems) which makes it easy to install and manage dependencies.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>But unlike Ruby, Crystal is statically type-checked, which means type errors will be caught early by the compiler rather than fail on runtime. Don\u2019t worry though, you don\u2019t need to explicitly define types as the compiler can intelligently infer types. Crystal also supports many modern features such as a macro system for powerful metaprogramming capabilities as well as support for concurrency, making it well-suited for high-performance and concurrent systems.<\/p>\n<p>Crystal has a wide range of applications, including web development, systems programming, and data processing. It is often <a href=\"https:\/\/crystal-lang.org\/used_in_prod\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">used by companies<\/a> such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.84codes.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">84codes<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/invidious.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Invidious<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.protel.com.tr\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Protel<\/a> for building web servers, web APIs, and web scraping tools, due to its performance and expressiveness. And since it is concurrent, Crystal is also suitable for building command-line tools, distributed systems, and data processing pipelines. Though Crystal is relatively niche even compared to other niche languages out there, Crystal programmers are one of the most highly paid developers according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/survey.stackoverflow.co\/2022\/#section-top-paying-technologies-top-paying-technologies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2022 Stack Overflow Developer survey<\/a>, with a median yearly salary of $84,690.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-79247 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1.png\" alt=\"Find your next course.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Best Courses Guides Methodology<\/h2>\n<p>I built this ranking following the now tried-and-tested methodology used in previous Best Courses Guides (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/category\/best-courses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">you can find them all here<\/a>).

Though the course name may sound like it&#8217;s only aimed towards Ruby developers, it actually means that it assumes no knowledge of types, pointers, concurrency, or other similar things. Non-ruby developers are welcomed!<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll cover the basics of writing your first Crystal program, types, concurrency, metaprogramming, and more. By the end, you\u2019ll have enough knowledge of Crystal to start exploring Crystal\u2019s frameworks and libraries.<\/p>\n<p>Prior experience with programming is required to take this course.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>After understanding the advantages of Crystal over Ruby and installing Crystal on your PC, you\u2019ll get right into writing your first Crystal program. You\u2019ll learn the basics of a Crystal project\u2009\u2014 implementing FizzBuzz in the language\u2009\u2014\u2009which will help you grasp Crystal\u2019s syntax and structure, as well as learn how to run Crystal programs.<\/p>\n<p>Rubyists love testing. You\u2019ll quickly discover that Crystal makes it easy to write and run tests using its built-in framework.<\/p>\n<p>Rubyists love dynamic typing; Crystal is statically typed. Though most of the time. Crystal doesn\u2019t feel like it&#8217;s statically typed anyways because you rarely need to specify the type thanks to intelligent type inference. And because of static types, you\u2019ll find out about method overloading, where you have different methods with the same name and different number of arguments.<\/p>\n<p>Crystal offers first-class support for concurrent programming through Channels. You\u2019ll learn how to spawn multiple messages at the same time. You&#8217;ll also discover how Crystal&#8217;s metaprogramming capabilities can rival those of Ruby (even though Ruby is interpreted whereas Crystal is compiled), along with how to interoperate with C libraries using C bindings. Because why write something that has already been written?<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course consists of 10 chapters.

I recommend that you supplement your learning with the 6th and 7th practical courses in this ranking.<\/p>\n<p>Prior programming experience is recommended, but not required.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll begin this course with the famous first message every programmer has ingrained into their brains\u2009\u2014\u2009\u201dHello World!\u201d. Although it&#8217;s simple, you\u2019ll get to know the structure of a Crystal program this way, that is top-level scope is treated as part of the main program.<\/p>\n<p>Next, you\u2019ll learn about variables and data types. One thing to note is that variables can be reassigned to different values and even different data types, which may feel a lot like dynamic types in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/best-ruby-courses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ruby<\/a>. Then, you\u2019ll also learn how to do arithmetic and string operations in Crystal, which are very much painless to perform.<\/p>\n<p>Every programming language needs to have control constructs as well as methods. You\u2019ll learn how to use conditionals and loops to have your program make or repeat decisions. Methods, on the other hand, allow you to avoid duplicating the same chunk of code. You\u2019ll learn how to create methods with arguments and type restrictions to ensure correctness of your program.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, you\u2019ll be given two examples of simple programs for you to explore. One of them is a command line application where you\u2019ll learn how to deal with getting user input and producing an output, whereas the other will open your eyes to server processing with HTTP servers.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is made up of multiple tutorials focusing on different aspects of the language.

Afterward, you\u2019ll engross yourself in the basic details of Crystal, such as installation and syntax. By creating a simple \u201cHello, World!\u201d program, you\u2019ll help crystallize the structure of a typical project into your mindspace, before diving deeper in the details.<\/p>\n<p>Next, you&#8217;ll explore decision-making with cases and if statements, and learn how to group and manipulate data with arrays, tuples, and hashes. You&#8217;ll also discover the power of procs and blocks for creating reusable code.<\/p>\n<p>Moving on, you\u2019ll get a test of the object-oriented side of Crystal with classes and modules. You&#8217;ll learn how to organize and structure code in larger projects, and grasp key OOP concepts like instantiation, inheritance, and polymorphism. These concepts will help you write complex and scalable software, making it easier to maintain and upgrade in the future.<\/p>\n<p>Crystal is a statically typed language. You\u2019ll learn and master types by first understanding their importance\u2009\u2014 to ensure code correctness at compile time. You\u2019ll also learn how to create and wield your own custom types to protect your code from potential errors too. Finally, you\u2019ll bring everything together by planning, building, and deploying Crystal projects, including managing dependencies and concurrency, through actual hands-on projects.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course consists of a course book, video tutorials, community resources, and projects. You\u2019ll learn by reading through the book chapters, watching videos about the Crystal language as well as videos by the instructor where they code hands-on, checking out the handy community resources, and most importantly, working on the larger coding projects.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Groxio<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Author<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Bruce A.

This is because G\u00e1bor Szab\u00f3 is an excellent teacher who can explain in detail what is happening on screen with his <a href=\"https:\/\/code-maven.com\/slides\/crystal\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">well-crafted slides and examples<\/a>. Though of course, it\u2019d be a much more effective learning experience if you were to follow along writing down code examples at home.<\/p>\n<p>The video series covers most but not all of the slides in the link, so by the end of the course, you\u2019ll have learned the basics of the Crystal language, including its syntax, type system, and how to run code. You should check out the slides, as they also give you exercises to try and complete.<\/p>\n<p>If you have an hour to spare to see what Crystal is all about, and also have some prior programming experience, this is a great course for you.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>In this course, you&#8217;ll learn the basics of the Crystal language. After some brief set up (running Crystal in a Docker container and exploring third party libraries called \u2018shards\u2019), you\u2019ll begin learning how variables and data types work in Crystal. Indeed, you\u2019ll be amazed by Crystal\u2019s static but versatile types, from primitive to compound types, and concatenating strings to doing mathematical operations on numbers. You\u2019ll be able to write a command line program that takes arguments passed into the standard input (STDIN) and prints a result to the screen.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also learn about early exit in Crystal, create basic shapes like rectangles, discover the concept of interactive environments, and also how to write Crystal one-liners. Last but not least, you\u2019ll learn how to generate random numbers in Crystal.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 3\u20134 hours long. You\u2019ll learn by watching the videos in the series and following along with the instructor. Additionally, you can complete the exercises given to strengthen your understanding of the Crystal programming concepts.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Chanell<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Code Maven<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td>YouTube<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td>G\u00e1bor Szab\u00f3<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Beginner<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td>3\u20134 hours<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Views<\/b><\/td>\n<td>1.2K<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Likes<\/b><\/td>\n<td>35<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td>None<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>Fun Facts<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">G\u00e1bor Szab\u00f3 is a programmer with almost 40 years of experience in programming languages such as Perl and Python.

Unlike the third course in this ranking however, this <b>paid <\/b>course by Timnan Sheni is friendly towards absolute beginners.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll learn how to write powerful, efficient, and concise programs in Crystal through four hands-on projects: a name guessing game; a rock, paper, scissors game; a simple calculator application; and lastly, an automatic file organizer.<\/p>\n<p>No prior programming experience is required to take this course!<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll start off this course by installing Crystal as well as its relevant extensions on VSCode to get the tooling out of the way.<\/p>\n<p>Next, you\u2019ll explore Crystal\u2019s data types, which are very much similar to Ruby\u2019s with types such as Strings, Numbers, Floats, and data structures like Arrays and Hashes. You\u2019ll focus on handling user input and then making decisions based on that by using control flow.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is control flow?\u201d, I hear you ask. Control flow consists of conditional statements such as if statements and loops such as while and unless loops that help the program choose between code paths or repeat blocks of code respectively. Armed with these concepts, you\u2019ll create a name guessing game (similar to hangman) and use nested logic to play rock, paper, scissors.<\/p>\n<p>The kind of programming you\u2019ve just done is called imperative programming, where instructions are written step-by-step to perform a task. But there\u2019s a more powerful programming paradigm called object-oriented programming, where instead of giving step-by-step instructions, you create &#8220;objects&#8221; that represent things or ideas in your program. Each object has its own properties (like name or color), can perform actions (like move or change color), and can even interact with each other. You\u2019ll make great use of these concepts when you develop a calculator app, before finally ending the course with a IO-intensive app that organizes files into folders based on their file format.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 3 hours long. You\u2019ll learn by watching the lecture videos and gaining hands-on experience by building various projects.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Udemy<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Timnan Sheni<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Beginner<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td>3 hours<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Enrollments<\/b><\/td>\n<td>4<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Rating<\/b><\/td>\n<td>N\/A<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Paid<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>Fun Facts<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Timnan Sheni is a software developer and tutor specializing in Ruby on Rails.
